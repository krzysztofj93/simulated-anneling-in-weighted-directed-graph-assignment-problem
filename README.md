## Simulated annealing for weighted directed graph assignment problem

### Problem statement
Let's assume we have a graph G = (V, E).

### Goals
* Choose/design input data and solution data models.
* Implement solution solving the problem.
* Test the algorithm for various weighted graphs.
* Test performance of various temperature ranges.
* Test performance of different temperature cooling methods:
    * 1
    * 2
* Visualize learning performance of tested cases.
